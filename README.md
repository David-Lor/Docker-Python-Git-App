# Docker Python Git App

[![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-DockerHub-blue?logo=docker&style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidlor/python-git-app)
![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/David-Lor/Docker-Python-Git-App/Build,%20Test%20&%20Push?style=plastic)

A Docker image to deploy a Python app from a Git repository, to avoid building a Docker image for each app.
The container will handle the git clone and requirements installing before the app starts for the first time.

## Features

- Clone from GIT repository
- Choose branch to clone
- Install requirements from `requirements.txt` file
- [Multiple base images & tags available](images.json)
- Multi-arch buildings: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7`
- Automatic builds on monday, wednesday and friday, for keeping images updated with the official base Python images

## Important! Required Python project structure

The entrypoint script expects the cloned repository to have the following structure:

```txt
ProjectRoot (cloned through Git)
│-  __main__.py (app entrypoint that will run)
|-  requirements.txt (if required)
│-  ...and all the other project files/directories
```

Some examples of projects compliant with this structure are:

- [Python-HelloWorld](https://github.com/David-Lor/Python-HelloWorld) (used as Git repository for testing this image)
- [MQTT2ETCD](https://github.com/David-Lor/MQTT2ETCD)
- [VigoBusAPI](https://github.com/David-Lor/Python_VigoBusAPI)
- [TelegramBot-Webhook-Updates-Receiver-Service](https://github.com/David-Lor/TelegramBot-Webhook-Updates-Receiver-Service)

## Getting started

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e GIT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/David-Lor/Python-HelloWorld.git" davidlor/python-git-app
```

## ENV Variables & ARGs

- `GIT_REPOSITORY`: URL of the remote Git repository to get the app from (required)
- `GIT_BRANCH`: set the Branch to clone from the Git repository (optional, default: use default branch)
- `APP_NAME`: name of your app. This name is given to the directory where project is cloned on(optional, default: _PythonApp_)
- (ARG) `USERNAME`: name of the user that is created on Dockerbuild to run the app with (optional, default: _user_)
- (ARG) `FROM_IMAGE`: base full image name to be used for the build (optional, default: _python:latest_)

Only required variable is (ENV) `GIT_REPOSITORY`.
The variables marked with (ARG) are [build-args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg), used on image build.

## Available tags

- The tags available for the image are a limited selection of tags used in base images, such as the [official Python images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/).
- The list of currently supported base images and output tags, used for periodic auto-builds, are available on the [images.json](images.json) file.
- Older images no longer supported may remain in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidlor/python-git-app/tags?page=1&ordering=-last_updated).

## Building

If you want to build this image (required in order to change default username, base image tag or building
for unsupported architedtures), you must do on host machine:

- Clone this repository
- Build a new Docker image using the repository directory - you can optionally set these ARGs:
  - a custom username using the `USERNAME` ARG
  - a custom base image using the `FROM_IMAGE` ARG (example: `python:alpine` or `python:slim`)
- Create a new container, setting up the desired ENV variables

```bash
git clone https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-Python-Autoclonable-App.git DockerPythonClonable
docker build DockerPythonClonable --build-arg USERNAME=user --build-arg FROM_IMAGE=python:slim -t yourname/yourtag:yourversion
docker run [...] yourname/yourtag:yourversion
```

## Entrypoint pipeline

The steps that run when the container starts are:

- If this is the first time the container runs:
    1. clear output directory
    2. git clone
    3. pip install requirements.txt
    4. create a status file to mark the container already ran this setup process
- Start the cloned app

## Caching requirements

The startup process of new containers may be lighten up by persisting the local cache (and even the installed libraries) in volumes.
This way, multiple containers, or the same container when being recreated for upgrading or reinstalling the running application, can skip the download and/or installing process.
The two directories that can be bind to volumes are:

- `/home/user/.cache`: cached libraries; mounting this volume will avoid downloading requirements
- `/home/user/.local`: installed libraries; mounting this volume will avoid installing requirements

**It is important that the mounted directories are owned by UID:GID 1000:1000**, since the container runs as a non-root user.

Example:

```bash
# Create the volumes, unless using binds
docker volume create pythongitapp-cache
docker volume create pythongitapp-local

# Change ownership
docker run -it --rm -v pythongitapp-local:/mnt/local -v pythongitapp-cache:/mnt/cache alpine sh -c "chown 1000:1000 /mnt/*"

# Run
docker run -it --rm -e GIT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/David-Lor/Python-HelloWorld.git" -e GIT_BRANCH="fastapi" -v pythongitapp-local:/home/user/.local -v pythongitapp-cache:/home/user/.cache davidlor/python-git-app

# Ctrl+C to stop it (container will be removed)
# "docker run" again for verifying that requirements are not downloaded/installed again
```

## Useful Make utils

- `make test` - run tests (requires root/sudo & pytest)
- `make test USE_SUDO=0` - run tests without sudo (if current user is root or part of docker group)
- `make test-classic` - run tests sequentially (make test runs in parallel using pytest-xdist)
- `make test-install-requirements` - pip install test requirements
- `sudo make build FROM_IMAGE=python:slim TO_TAG=slim` - build the image with the `python:slim` base image, and tag as `python-git-app:slim`
- `sudo make build FROM_IMAGE=python:alpine TO_IMAGE=my-python:latest` - build the image with the `python:alpine` base image, and tag as `my-python:latest`
